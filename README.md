# GUinstructor-Code

Hello!

This repository is used by Geering Up, and stores all the completed code for Winter Workshops (2018). The code here is meant to serve as potential "solutions" to the skeleton code given to students during workshops. It is meant for the instructor's viewing only, to help guide and troubleshoot the students throughout the workshop.

Have fun!
