# GUinstructor-Code

Hello!

This repository is used by Geering Up, and stores all the completed code for Winter Workshops (2018). The code here are meant to be the "solutions" to the skeleton code given to the students during workshops. It is meant for the instructor's viewing only, to help guide and troubleshoot the students throughout the workshop.

Have fun!
